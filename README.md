stripper is dependent on the rename package. It is meant to be used to create a folder structure where each directory contains a video file and subtitle files and the names of the directories have the title and year in them. If there are subdirectories, they will be ignored.

As of now, stripper does not know which subtitle file you want to keep if there are more than one, so you have to delete the ones you don't want before you run the script.
